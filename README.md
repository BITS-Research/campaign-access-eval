# Access 2020 Local Elections

A proof of concept to evaluate the accessibility of political campaign digital materials.

## Background

To better understand how political campaigns make their platforms accessible to their constituents,
we are building tools to help quickly and easily evaluate their campaign website (and potentially,
any additionally linked materials -- i.e. PDFs of their plans).

For example, are political campaigns taking the time to ensure all elements of their digital materials
are accessible to low-or-no vision individuals. Are political campaigns ensuring that their materials
are available in multiple languages?

In many cases we can combine the data produced by our tools with census data regarding disability
populations and language-spoken-at-home statistics. But we can also study correlations between
web accessibility and campaign spending.

## Produced Data

Planned:

1. AXE basic info -- some normalized score?
